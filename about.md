I started off as an admin who just loves to automate everything. As time progressed, I ran into situations, where I needed a tool or a software suite, that either wasn't available freely or just didn't meet
my exact requirements. Now I program in Python, Ruby, and GoLang. I'm the 1st developer and as of now, the only developer still working on [vFense](http://github.com/vFense/vFense) the Cross platform patch management suite.

<p>Quick update today! User Christianha, pointed out to me that the port_report tool was not matching any MAC address he passed. The reason for this is because he was passing the MAC address in uppercase. As per his suggestion, I fixed line 348 so that before it returns the mac, it willl make the MAC lower case. Then I just realized something.... I reverted line 348 back to way it was and changed line 676 instead..</p>
<p>It was if nmac == cmac:<br />
Now it isÂ  re.search(nmac, cmac, re.IGNORECASE):</p>
<p>I felt this was the safer option..</p>
<p>Thank you Christianha for pointing the issues out..</p>
<p>LD Port Report == {filelink=15}</p>

<p>The reason we built <a href="/" target="_parent" title="Linuxdynasty">http://linuxdynasty.org</a> was for this section. We remember how difficult it was ( <strong>AND STILL IS</strong>) to find good easy to read documentation. I mean there are ton's of references out there but not enough straight to the point how to's.</p>
<p><a href="images/stories/pictures/Terminal.png" title="man page" rel="rokzoom[linuxdynasty]"><img class="terminal" src="http://linuxdynasty.org/wp-content/themes/twentyten/images/stories/pictures/Terminal.png" border="0" width="287" height="178" align="left" /></a></p>
<p>For instance, the Linux/BSD man pages have been good to me, but you know as well as I do that those man pages just do not give you the answer you are looking for right when you needed or sometime the information is so obscured that you are like "This is crazy".</p>
<p> All that being said we are hoping to provide the community with easy to read how to's that get straight to the point.</p>
<p>Please email us for tutorials that you would like to see and we will do our best to get one for you and everyone else. If you join our community you will be able to create your own how to's, with our approval first of course :).</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this site as much as we do. </p>

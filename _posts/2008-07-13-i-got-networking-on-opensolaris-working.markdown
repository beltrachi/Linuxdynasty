<p>Wow this was a real mission for me and a learning experience... I'm updating you from my OpenSolaris box right now :).....&nbsp; Essentially in a nutshell, I had to run /usr/X11R6/bin/scanpci -v to find out what typ of network card I had installed (NVIDIA MCP61). I then googled that on the net and it returned this wonderful link <a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/mrym3/taiyodo/nfo-2.6.0.tar.gz" title="">&quot;http://homepage2.nifty.com/mrym3/taiyodo/nfo-2.6.0.tar.gz&quot;</a>&nbsp; . This driver was the missing link in my quest to get networking.</p>
<p>I will create&nbsp; a tutorial on howto setup networking under OpenSolaris in a few hours after I get a nap. </p>

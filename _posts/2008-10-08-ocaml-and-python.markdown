<p>He guys, I'm here listening to the debate and all I can think about is should I take the time to learn Ocaml. Always seems like there is not enough time in the day to be come an expert in one language to pick up another language. All of my focus has been on python and trying to become a better python programmer.</p>
<p>Today I came across Ocaml, Objective C Meta Language. Now I want to learn that. But how do I continure to improve my Python skills while learning Ocaml????</p>

<p>I would love to here your comments..... </p>

<p>So for anyone that come through this site, are they any HowTo's you would like to see get put up?</p>
<p>I've been working on alot of scripting and programming lately and thats why I have been focusing on that area.</p>
<p>I'm going to be putting up some Perl Scripts that interact with the<br />
Perl SDK for VMWare ESX 3.0+ servers. Might be interesting to some<br />
people. As well as a new python project I am starting to work on that I will make opensource.</p>
<p>I would like suggestions from people out there on what they would like<br />
to see on this site. It does not have to be just linux/unix or<br />
programming, it can also be networking or windows.</p>
<p>We are looking for IDEAS, so Please join and comment. </p>

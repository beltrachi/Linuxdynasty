<p>Today I was thinking of adding some more features to the site. But before I do that, I want to ask the help of the linuxdynasty community. Also I want some feedback on the site... Good or Bad!</p>
<ul>
<li>What features would you like to see on the site?</li>
<li>If you can change something what would that be?</li>
<li>I would like to make the forums more active. Any Suggestions?</li>
<li>We are looking for more Authors as well. Do any of you guys want to contribute HowTo's or Scripts? </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm currently working for The New School University, and I must say I really do like the place. There is so much that I can bring to the table as well as technologies that I have yet to learn. One thing that I have done quite a bit of in the past is Programming to the VMware SDK in Perl and some Python scripting for the NIC reordering issue.</p>
<p>Now I'm working on writing some Scripts in PowerShell for Windows. I am also learning about the management aspect of VMware VC and VMware Clustering and Vmotion. Also Researching Kerberos with Securid, and getting ready to deploy Puppet and Subversion. And more to come....</p>
<p>So you should see some upcoming HowTo's as well as Scripts in Perl/Python/Ruby, and just maybe PowerShell.... I want to apologize for not updating the site in over a month but I was affected by this horrible economy and I was just not into it and now that I am back working... <strong>You best believe that I am 110% back!!!!!!!! </strong></p>

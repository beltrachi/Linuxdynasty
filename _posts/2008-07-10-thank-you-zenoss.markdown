  best to convert as many people from Nagios and the other Monitoring systems to&nbsp;
  Zenoss. Zenoss is the first product that I have become truly attached to. Because
  of Zenoss I am now a Python evangelist and most of my code is programmed in Python.<br

<p>I would like to take the time to thank Zenoss for sending me this wonderful Jacket. I've been using Zenoss now for almost 2 years now and I've been trying my best to convert as many people from Nagios and the other Monitoring systems to&nbsp; Zenoss. Zenoss is the first product that I have become truly attached to. Because of Zenoss I am now a Python evangelist and most of my code is programmed in Python.<br />

<p>Zenoss is truly a great Open Source monitoring system. It has an intuitive front end that can be compared to any of the Dominating Monitoring Solutions. Zenoss supports SNMP traps, SNMP Monitoring, Graphing/Trending, Central Syslogging, as well as uses the Nagios API for command checks. I have in numerous occasions have created programs that would sync Zenoss up either with a Mysql CMDB or a Load Balancer device like the Netscaler 9000, by syncing up zenoss with a cmdb or other devices it eliminated the need to update Zenoss manually into it proper groups. </p>
<p>Thank you Zenoss for everything...</p>

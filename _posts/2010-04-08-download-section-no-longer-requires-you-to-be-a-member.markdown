<p>I first made the Download Section for members only, just cause I wanted an idea on who is downloading the software I have written. Now, I no longer care who downloads it, as long as it helps out the people who did download it. That is all that matters. Though the forums section, does require you to be a member. I also recognize, most people are members of enough websites, that becoming a member of another one, can be over bearing.</p>

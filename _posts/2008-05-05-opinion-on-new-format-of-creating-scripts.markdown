<p>ikenticus created a tutorial/script on zenoss but instead of just doing it in one language he did it in 5 different languages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Perl</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Python</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shell</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">PHP</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ruby</span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Expect</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I was thinking of following his format for all of our tutorials that involve Programming/Scripting. I think this will greatly enhance the understanding of how to write and compare different programming languages.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you feel about this and ony other <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">IDEAS</span></strong> that you may have.</p>
<p>Either by email or in the forums or in the comment section but we are looking to here from you guys/gals.</p>
<p>We are looking to build a strong community with a focus on&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">GREAT/EASY</span></strong>&nbsp;to read&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">TUTORIALS</span></strong> as well as <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Scripting/Programming</span></strong>.</p>

<p>I've been a Linux Administrator for about 6+ years now and I love Linux now more then I did then. Though I do not particularly like being a Admin or an Engineer any more. I actually prefer being an Architect or a Systems Programmer. As bad as the economy is right now, there are quite a few jobs out there. Especially for Linux System Administrators/Engineers!</p>
<p>The problem these days, is that the Linux SA's which <strong>WERE</strong> and <strong>ARE</strong> still highly regarded. Are being flooded with <u><strong>LAZY</strong></u> admins that have and continue to flood the Networking and Microsoft world. In the past year, I have met a few interesting Microsoft Engineers who actually knew the product very well. Besides the normal right click and actually knew how to script and automate ( This baffled me ).</p>

<p>Let me get back to the real issue. That is that I have in recent times, met Linux admins with those same poor qualities of the average not caring for their job Windows Admins. This really bothered me inside! As I hold the Linux community with the utmost respect. Seeing this happening in our community is like a slap in the face! I have come to the conclusion that all communities have these types of admins and not just the Microsoft communities.</p>
<p>Let me be specific on the type of Admins that I mean....</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Admin who always comes to ask you a question, but does not really care what the answer is. As long as the answer is right!</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Admin who portrays himself as the King or Queen of a product, but only knows how to use the product. While in reality he or she does not really understand how the product works.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Admin who knows that a problem exists and will not even attempt to fix the issue and wait till someone else alleviates the issue.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The issues above are just the main offenders as there are more situations then the ones given above.</p>
<p>I here all the time from fellow co-workers to people chatting in forums or in blogs on how people are having a hard time finding a job in this market. I tell the same thing to anyone in my field and that is { <strong>YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE YOUR SELF FROM THE COMMON ADMI</strong>N }. This seems to confuse most people. What I mean by this, is <u><strong>what separates you from the other 100,000+ admins out there</strong></u>? Why do they want to hire you over the college graduate who more then likely just partied the whole time in college.</p>
<p>The answers that I always give are the 3 below.... </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You have to love what you do!</strong></li>
<li><strong>You should learn how to script, it could be in Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Visual Basic, Power Shell, Expect, etc...</strong></li>
<li><strong>Automation, which has to deal with the above.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most admins out there can not do basic scripting and will work on the same task over and over and over.... This is a complete lost of time for you and for the company you work for. So for all of you who read this article and are asking the questions below...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Either out of a job</strong></li>
<li><strong>About to be laid off</strong></li>
<li><strong>You are always asking your self why am I not a Sr admin yet? <br />
</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why am I not making 100k+ yet?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Look above and ask yourself do you have those skills? Do you still love what you do?</p>
<p>Once you can answer those questions honestly, then you will understand why you are where you are at today. For those of you who already knew the secrets above then this is not news to you. </p>

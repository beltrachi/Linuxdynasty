<p>For those of you who visit linuxdynasty everyday, you might have notice some subtle changes in the authorization aspect fo the site. I had to enable captch images in the login, and posting parts of the site. Since for the past few weeks, spammers have been hitting the comments and forums section. I'm hoping this does not annoy everyone, but the spamming is starting to really annoy me.</p>

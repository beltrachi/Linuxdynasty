    This is perfect.\r\n\r\nI've tried the links on your website but can't seem to
    find a download. Can I get a copy of this from you?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"

<p>It is official, I have begun development on the Web Server and Database for the Port Report Project and the Network Device Manager Project. I will be combining both scripts into a True Network Device Manager. My goal is to create an Open Source Network Device Manager that will give Admins and Engineers complete Insight/Access to their network. It does not matter if you want to know which switch your ESX host is directly connected to or if you want to manage all your Switches/Linux Hosts with this product. We have a few more ideas on what we want to do, but they are just ideas and I will not post them yet.</p>
<p>I will be using Python, Pexpect, PySnmp, SQLAlchemy, and Django for this project. I'm hoping to have an Alpha for users to test by late November or early December. If you are interested in this project, please give me ideas on what you would like to see in this Project. Currently we do not have an official name for the project.Â  If you have one, let me know as well. All ideas are welcome, as we are trying to make a complete enterprise product out of this project.</p>

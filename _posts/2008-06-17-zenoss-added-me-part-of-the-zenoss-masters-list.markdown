<p>I would like to thank Zenoss for adding me to there Zenoss Master List. Because of Zenoss I learned the Python programming language and it is now my preferred language of choice. Zenoss to me is the best Open Source monitoring solution out there. I feel they beat HP Openview/Tivoli/ and the others Hands Down. I was able to integrate Zenoss with Citrix Netscalers, Custom built CMDB's and other products.</p>

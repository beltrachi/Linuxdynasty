<p>It is hard when you work for a company who does not want you to share code that you have written, even though the code does not show anything about the environment I currently work in. I'm going to try and submit some updates in the next few days... I've been working with TurboGears alot lately, hopefully I can finish the one out of four projects that I have started soon and I will post them soon. </p>

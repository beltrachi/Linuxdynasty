<p>I was trying to download this script from the entry "Akamai: Collecting and Graphing":</p>
<p>http://www.linuxdynasty.org/View-details/Perl-Scripts/18-akamai_collector.pl.html</p>
<p>I keep getting redirected to the homepage. Â Is there a way I could get this script?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Eric Garcia</p>

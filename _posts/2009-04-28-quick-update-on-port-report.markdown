<p>As of right now I am very close on getting Nortel to work. I have been testing with Kshort and I'm hoping to have the Nortel part of this script done by tomorrow night. Once Nortel is done, then I will start working on getting Foundry Switches supported. Then I'll release revision 1.7. If any members have run this script on Dell switches, please let me know if it worked or if if did not work. If it did not work, please contact me directly and I will try to get it supported as well.</p>

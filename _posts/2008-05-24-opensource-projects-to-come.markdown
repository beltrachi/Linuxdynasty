<p>For the people who have been checking out LinuxDynasty.... We have begun our own OpenSource project (More like a few, but lets start one at a time)!!! We will be posting updates in the days to come. One of the projects we are about to start is a front end for Kickstart and more.. We do not have the specifics yet but we are in the midst of discussion. We are going to build the gui using <a href="http://turbogears.org/" title="">turbogears</a> and <a href="http://python.org/" title="">python</a>. If you are interested in helping and being a part of a OpenSource project then please join the site and private message me. </p>
<p>We will apply this project to sourceforge once we have a beta.. In the meantime I will start a Trac instance and only members who are part of this project will have access to this area.</p>

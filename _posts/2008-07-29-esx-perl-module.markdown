<p>Greetings to all of my VMware ESX 3.x people.....&nbsp; Here I introduce to you my latest Perl Module. I've spent a considerable amount of time creating an ESX Virtual Machine Perl Module which is essentially an easier way to interact with the Perl SDK for VMware. </p>

<p>I had to rewrite this module, but in doing so I made the code cleaner and smaller. The reason I had to rewrite this Perl Module was because&nbsp; I originally written it for a bank that I use to work for and they are very strict in sharing code as they do not want to give the upper hand to any of there competitors.</p>
<p>Also I have a <a href="http://www.linuxdynasty.org/vmadmin-perl-script.html" title="vmadmin-perl-script">CGI Script</a> that I also had written previously and had to rewrite it as well..&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.linuxdynasty.org/vmadmin-perl-script.html" title="vmadmin-perl-script">CGI script</a> will use this Perl Module to its full extent. This Script will also give you an example on how to write scripts that use this Perl Module. </p>
<p>This module provides features such as....</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating SnapShots</li>
<li>Deleting SnapShots</li>
<li>Reverting to a particular SnapShot</li>
<li>Deleting All Snapshots on a Particular VM</li>
<li>Shutting Down a VM</li>
<li>Cleanly Shutting Down a VM (VM Tools Required)
</li>
<li>Reseting a VM</li>
<li>Cleanly Rebooting a VM (VM Tools Required)</li>
<li>Turning on a VM</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p></p>
<p>I will continue to add more functionality in the near future, if you want to add more functionality just become a member and email me and I will give you access to my Subversion repository.</p>
<p>I know I still need to add more error checking, so that is in the works.... </p>

<p>I have not yet finished my testing with Nortel and Foundry. Once that is complete, then I will post 1.7 revision. Though in the mean while I was able to enhance the --report option of the port_report.py script.</p>
<p>It use to take me about 13 minutes to scan our 6509 Core Switch and I was just able to do it under 4 minutes.Â  So when I do post the update, not only will you get 2 more brands supported you will also get speed improvements as well. </p>

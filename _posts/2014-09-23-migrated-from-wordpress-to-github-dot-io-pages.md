I just finished migrating from wordpress, and I love haveing the simplicity of 
just managing static pages and being able to edit right from vim.
I will be updating my old posts little by little, so if a download link is not valid
than just check my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/linuxdynasty/Linuxdynasty)

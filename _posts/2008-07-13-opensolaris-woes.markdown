<p>Recently I took an interest in learning OpenSolaris, and let me tell you, to me it's like learning a different language. I am still not able to get my box with simple networking... (</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did a #$%^ load of googling and I found out how to scan the devices on OpenSolaris &quot;/usr/X11R6/bin/scanpci -v&quot; By doing that I found that the current driver I have loaded is not the correct driver, now to find the correct driver and load that bad boy up. I'm going to load up alot of howtos on OpenSolaris once I got a grip of the situation. </p>

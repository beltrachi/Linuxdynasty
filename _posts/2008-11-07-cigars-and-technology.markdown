excerpt: ! "<p>For those of you who do know me, know that I just recently started
  a new hobby. That hobby is smoking Cigars! For those of you who might ask if I have
  smoke ciggarretes before the answer is <strong>NO</strong>. I love the smell of
  Cigars, and how relaxed I feel afterwards. Also I like the different flavors you
  get from the different Cigars out there, and NO I do not like flavor Cigars. The
  type of Cigars that I usually like to smoke are Medium to Full bodied Cigars like
  Corojo/Maduro type Cigars.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>Lately I have been smoking the brand
  Camacho Cigars which they mainly make are full bodied Cigars.&nbsp; For instance
  I just bought a box of Camacho Corojo/Maduro Figurado Cigars from <a href=\"http://atlanticcigar.com\"
  title=\"\">Atlantic Cigar</a>. They have a shop not to far from my house in Stroudsburg
  Pennsylvania. I usually get my Cigars from them as they usually have better prices
  then Cigars International, Famous-smoke and JR Cigars.</p></p>\r\n<br />"

<p>For those of you who do know me, know that I just recently started a new hobby. That hobby is smoking Cigars! For those of you who might ask if I have smoke ciggarretes before the answer is <strong>NO</strong>. I love the smell of Cigars, and how relaxed I feel afterwards. Also I like the different flavors you get from the different Cigars out there, and NO I do not like flavor Cigars.

<p><p>Luckily for me I have a good friend ( Keith ) who gave me 2 humidors full of Cigars, with all types of Cigars from Mild to Medium to Knock you on your butt Cigars. That's how I quickly learned what type of Cigars fits me in a very short amount of time. Since I've only been smoking for the past 3 months or so. In the 3 months that I have been smoking I went from loving Maduro type Cigars too Mild/Medium Cigars and now Corojo and Maduro type Cigars.</p></p>
<p>So far I have 4 favorite brands and they are...</p>
<ul>
<li>Camacho</li>
<li>Gran Habano</li>
<li>J. Fuego</li>
<li>There is no name for this Cigar yet as Atlantic Cigar is working on Manufacturing these Cigars, but I have had the privileged of tasting a few of them and I must say I do love them, especially the Connecticut&nbsp; Shade Wrapper Cigar that I smoked last week.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>I know there will be more that I will be adding to this list, but as of right now those are my top 4.</p>
<p><p>I would like to know those of you who are into technology and smoke Cigars just like I do. I would like to know what type of Cigars you like, and how they make you feel? I might start posting pictures of the type of Cigars i smoke and maybe doing some reviews of them as well.... Who knows maybe putting a Cigar next to my Linux Work Stations :P</p></p>
